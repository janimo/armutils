ARMUtils - some Unix commands written in ARM assembly language
--------------------------------------------------------------

Old code inspired by http://asm.sourceforge.net/asmutils.html
dug out of backups and finally published 8 years after registering
the sf.net armutils project.

This was my small contribution to the geographically distributed,
loosely coordinated, selfless and unintentional community effort
of clueless hacker-wannabes towards making SF a central repository
of unfinished, orphaned or not even started open source pet-projects,
for which I am sorry.

It contains a few dumb clones of UNIX commands written for ARM Linux
in ARM assembly language, currently cat, head, tail, kill, ln, mkdir,
mount, ping, swapon, and a very simple HTTP server.
They have educational value at most, you should use busybox if you really
want small footprint but reasonable functionality.

They were developed on an Intel StrongARM board and there was a cross-building
attempt as well as you can see in the Makefiles. Feel free to update them
for newer ARM Linux hardware if you have some, figure out step 2, then profit.

Do not mail me for support though, I have mostly forgotten this and haven't
worked with ARM for years.
